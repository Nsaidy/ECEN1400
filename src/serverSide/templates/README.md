#Index.html

This is not a functional site, it is only a template to use with flask. It uses jinja2 to embed data on the site such as the user name and the status. For future versions, it will also loop through all of the messages that have been sent through the phone. But for now, Amanda security is not functional (nothing breaks if you use it though)
